Snake Game Description

The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen. The snake continuously grows as it eats food, which appears at random positions on the screen. The game ends if the snake runs into the screen boundaries or itself.

Key Features:

Snake Movement: The snake moves continuously in a specified direction (up, down, left, or right). The player can change the direction using arrow keys or other specified controls.

Food Generation: Food (often represented as a dot or another symbol) appears randomly on the screen. When the snake consumes the food, it grows longer, typically by adding a new segment to its tail.

Snake movement in four directions: up, down, left, right.
Random generation of food on the screen.
Score tracking: Each time the snake eats food, the score increases.
